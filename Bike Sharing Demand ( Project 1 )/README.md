Bike-sharing systems offer a modern and convenient way to rent bicycles through an automated process involving membership acquisition, bicycle rental, and return across a network of kiosk locations scattered throughout cities. These systems allow individuals to pick up a bicycle at one location and return it to another, catering to the user's convenience and promoting urban mobility. With over 500 such programs worldwide, bike-sharing has become a pivotal element of urban transportation.

The wealth of data generated by bike-sharing systems is particularly valuable to researchers. This data captures essential details such as travel duration, departure points, destinations, and time, effectively turning these systems into a sensor network for urban mobility studies. In this context, a challenge has been set to leverage historical usage patterns along with weather data to predict bike rental demand within the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

My objective is to accurately forecast the demand for bike rentals on any given day, utilizing a range of variables that include weather conditions, dates, and times, among others.

To achieve this, I employed the Amazon AutoML library, Autogluon, which facilitated the creation of stacked classifiers through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. This model demonstrated significant predictive power, securing the 7th position on the private Kaggle Leaderboard.

Through this analysis, I discovered distinct trends that underscore the impact of weather conditions, whether it's a workday or holiday, and the time of day on bike rental patterns. These insights were visually represented in a series of plots, enhancing the understanding of the data's underlying patterns.

Moreover, I explored the correlations between the engineered features, providing a clear picture of the factors driving bike rental demand. The progress and methodological advancements were documented and illustrated by a score progression plot that highlights the journey towards optimizing the prediction model.

Best Score: 0.35412

This project not only showcases the potential of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges but also emphasizes the significance of feature engineering and data analysis in enhancing model performance. Through this endeavor, my aim was to contribute valuable insights into urban mobility patterns, offering a foundation for further research and development in bike-sharing demand forecasting.

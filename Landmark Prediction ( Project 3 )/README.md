# Landmark Classification Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I am tackling the challenge of building a pipeline to process real-world images supplied by users and integrating my model into an app. The primary goal is to enable the app to predict the most likely locations of these images.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the need of photo sharing and storage services to have location data for each uploaded photo. This data is crucial for enabling advanced features like automatic tag suggestions or photo organization, thereby enhancing the user experience. However, a significant challenge arises when photos lack location metadata, which is where this kind of classification becomes useful.

## Project Goals

In this project, I am developing an AI app to automatically predict an image's location based on landmarks. The end goal is for my app to accept any user-supplied image and suggest the top 'k' most relevant landmarks from a list of 50 landmarks worldwide.

## Dataset Info

The images used are from a subset of the Google Landmarks Dataset v2.
